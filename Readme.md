## Detailed Descriptions

### **Algorithm Control Panel**
A comprehensive interface for algorithm visualization featuring real-time complexity analysis, side-by-side code view with highlighting, variable state tracking, and step-by-step execution controls. This is the main educational tool for understanding algorithm behavior.

### **Topics Overview**
The learning catalog that organizes DSA topics by difficulty level. Each topic card shows subtopics, estimated learning time, and quick access to visualization and quiz features.

### **Homepage**
The main entry point of the application with primary navigation options and a brief overview of recent user activity. Designed to be clean and inviting for new users.

### **Code Editor**
An interactive coding workspace where users can write, run, and test their own DSA implementations. Includes template algorithms, real-time output console, and visual feedback for code execution.

### **Assessment Interface**
The quiz/testing section where users can evaluate their knowledge on specific DSA topics. Tracks previous scores and provides targeted practice based on performance.

### **Progress Dashboard**
A personalized dashboard showing learning statistics, achievements, recent activities, and overall progress. Helps users track their learning journey and stay motivated.

### **Enhanced Homepage**
An updated version of the homepage with more detailed progress tracking, showing precise timestamps of recent activities and improved user engagement features.
